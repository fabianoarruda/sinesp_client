# Ruby Sinesp Client

This gem provides a client for searching vehicle data based on the license plate from Sinesp database. This data is publicly available at https://www.sinesp.gov.br/sinesp-cidadao. The gem just makes it easier to fetch results, through the same endpoint used by the mobile app. 

For a python version, please check this: https://github.com/victor-torres/sinesp-client

Inspirated by [Original gem](https://github.com/fabianoarruda/sinesp_client)
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sinesp-client'
```

And then execute:

## Usage

```ruby
require "sinesp-client"
SinespClient.search 'ABC1234'
```

## Limitations

Sinesp seems to block connections originated from outside of Brazil. TODO: make the gem work with proxy.
